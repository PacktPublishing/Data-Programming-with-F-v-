Data Programming with F# (v) [Video] by Packt Publsihing


About the Video Course:</br>
Today, developers are tasked with building applications in less time, while maintaining high standards of quality, reliability, security, and performance.
This video course presents practical techniques for handling real-world data programming challenges. We'll first see how to build efficient, extensible engines to parse and process documents and data streams. Then we'll study how to process large sets of data with maximal performance and efficiency using asynchronous workflows, agents, and .NET reactive extensions. Next, we'll learn to use type providers, a unique F# feature that lets us program with data as if it were code.
By the end of the course, you will be capable of writing solutions with less code, fewer bugs, and better alignment with business requirements.
